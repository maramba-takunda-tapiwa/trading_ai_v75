# TROUBLESHOOTING: No Activity After Saving Credentials

The system is DEPLOYED but you're not seeing any trade activity. Here's what to check:

## Quick Check List

### 1. ✅ Credentials ARE Saved
Your credentials file exists at:
- `c:\Users\maram\trading_ai_v75\results\saxo_config.json`

Contents verified - your 3 credentials are there.

### 2. ⏳ Give It More Time
- **First 30-60 seconds**: Trader is connecting to Saxo and downloading market data
- **After 1-2 minutes**: Should start seeing trade opportunities on hourly candles
- **Expected first trade**: Within 2-4 hours (depends on entry signals)

### 3. ❌ Possible Issues & Solutions

#### Issue A: Credentials May Be Invalid
**Symptom**: No trades after 5+ minutes, no errors visible

**Solution**:
1. Go to Saxo Developer Portal
2. Verify your App ID, Access Token, Account ID are correct
3. Check if Access Token has expired (usually 24-hour expiration)
4. Get a new Access Token if needed
5. Go to Settings tab → Update credentials
6. Click Deploy again

**How to get fresh credentials:**
```
1. Login: https://www.developers.saxo/openapi/
2. Apps → Your App → Copy App ID
3. Authorization → Get new Access Token
4. Save your demo Account ID (from Saxo login page)
```

#### Issue B: Access Token Expired
**Symptom**: Trader starts but no actual trades execute

**Solution**:
1. Get a new Access Token from Saxo
2. Update Settings → Access Token field
3. Click "Save Credentials"
4. Go to Overview → Click "Stop" first
5. Wait 5 seconds
6. Click "Deploy" again

#### Issue C: Demo Account Insufficient Balance
**Symptom**: Credentials are valid but no trades

**Solution**:
1. Login to your Saxo demo account
2. Check account balance (should be > $10,000)
3. If < $10,000, deposit more
4. Try deployment again

#### Issue D: Wrong Account ID
**Symptom**: Trader runs but errors about account not found

**Solution**:
1. Login to https://app.saxo/
2. Go to Account → Account Information
3. Look for Account Number or Account ID
4. Make sure it's your DEMO account, not live
5. Update Settings with correct ID

#### Issue E: API Connectivity Issue
**Symptom**: Trader process keeps crashing

**Solution**:
1. Check Docker logs: `docker-compose logs --tail=50`
2. Look for error messages about saxophone connection
3. Restart container:
   ```
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## What SHOULD Happen

### Timeline:
```
T+0 min     : You click Deploy
T+0-1 min   : Trader initializes, connects to Saxo
T+1-2 min   : Starts downloading hourly price data
T+2-5 min   : Evaluating entry signals (waiting for hourly candle close)
T+5-120 min : First trade may appear IF signals aligned
```

### Files That Should Exist:
After successful deployment, these files should appear:
- ✅ `live_trades_log_v2.csv` - All trades logged here
- ✅ `trader_state_v2.json` - Current trader status
- ✅ `saxo_config.json` - Your credentials (you just created this)

### What You'll See On Dashboard:
- Trades table starts populating
- Equity curve line starts moving
- Metrics update (win rate, profit factor, etc)
- Alerts appear if limits triggered

---

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### View Docker Container Logs:
```powershell
docker-compose logs --tail=100 | Find "ERROR"
```

### Restart Everything:
```powershell
# Stop container
docker-compose down

# Wait a few seconds
Start-Sleep -Seconds 3

# Restart
docker-compose up -d

# Check it's running
docker-compose ps
```

### Manual Deployment Cycle:
```powershell
# 1. Stop trader
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost/api/stop" -Method POST

# 2. Wait
Start-Sleep -Seconds 3

# 3. Redeploy
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost/api/deploy" -Method POST

# 4. Wait and refresh dashboard
Start-Sleep -Seconds 10

# Then open http://localhost in browser
```

---

## Next Step

1. **Try Again**: Wait another 5 minutes and refresh the dashboard
2. **Check Credentials**: If still nothing, verify each credential field exactly matches Saxo
3. **Get Fresh Token**: If credentials look right, try a new Access Token
4. **Contact Support**: If still stuck, the issue is likely credentials/account balance

## Common Questions

**Q: Why no trades yet?**
A: Either (1) still initializing, (2) invalid credentials, or (3) waiting for entry signal.

**Q: How do I know if it's actually running?**
A: Open http://localhost → Go to Overview → Look for "DEPLOYED" status and timestamps.

**Q: What if I see "STOPPED" status?**
A: Click Deploy again to restart the trader.

**Q: The access token is long and complex - did I copy it right?**
A: Yes, copy the ENTIRE token exactly as Saxo shows it. Even 1 character wrong breaks it.

**Q: It still says it's loading after 10 minutes...**
A: Stop and restart the container: `docker-compose down; docker-compose up -d`

## Success Indicators

✅ Status shows "DEPLOYED"  
✅ Deployment time is recent (last few minutes)  
✅ Trades table HAS at least 1 row  
✅ Equity chart shows a line  
✅ Metrics show non-zero values  

If you see all 5 of these, the system is working correctly!
