# YOUR NEXT 3 STEPS

## The System is Ready. Here's What You Do Now.

---

## STEP 1: Open Dashboard (30 seconds)

### In Your Browser:
```
http://localhost
```

You should see:
- Header: "Trading AI V2 Dashboard"
- 4 tabs: Overview | Trades | Charts | Settings
- Big green "Deploy" button
- Metrics cards showing:
  - Deployment Status: NOT_DEPLOYED
  - Current Equity: $10,000
  - Max Drawdown: $0
  - Win Rate: 0%

✅ If you see this, move to Step 2.

---

## STEP 2: Add Your Saxo Credentials (1-2 minutes)

### Click "Settings" Tab

You should see two sections:
- Left: "Deployment Configuration" (read-only)
- Right: "Saxo Bank Credentials" (form)

### Fill In Your Credentials

Enter these fields:
- **App ID:** Your Saxo application ID
- **Access Token:** Your Saxo bearer token (long string starting with "eyJ...")
- **Account ID:** Your Saxo account ID (usually numeric)

### Save

Click the big **"Save Credentials"** button.

Wait for the green checkmark: **"✅ Credentials saved successfully!"**

✅ If you see the green message, move to Step 3.

**❌ If you see an error:**
- Check that all 3 fields are filled
- Make sure tokens are copied correctly (no extra spaces)
- Try again

## STEP 3: Deploy (1-2 minutes)

### Go Back to Overview Tab

Click the **"Overview"** tab at the top.

### Click Deploy

Find the big green **"Deploy"** button in the "Controls" section.

Click it.

### Confirm Dialog

A dialog appears asking:
*"Start demo deployment on Saxo account? This will run for 48-72 hours..."*

Click **"Deploy"** to confirm.

### Wait

The dashboard will:
1. Show "DEPLOYING..." for a moment
2. Change to **"Deployment Status: DEPLOYED"**
3. Start updating metrics every 5 seconds

✅ If you see "DEPLOYED", you're live! Move to Step 4.

## STEP 4: Watch It Trade (Automatic)

### What Happens Next (Automatic, No Action Needed)

1. **Trader launches** in background
2. **Connects to Saxo** demo account
3. **Downloads data** (EUR/USD hourly)
4. **Analyzes market** looking for breakouts
5. **Executes trades** when conditions met
6. **Logs each trade** to CSV
7. **Updates dashboard** in real-time

### Where to Look

**Trades Tab:**
- First trade usually appears within 30-120 minutes
- You'll see columns: Time, Entry, Exit, R, P&L, Outcome, Equity

**Charts Tab:**
- Equity curve shows as line
- Updates after each trade closes

**Overview Tab:**
- Metrics update every 5 seconds
- Watch: Win Rate, Max DD, Profit Factor

### What to Expect (72 Hours)

- **Hour 4:** Usually 1-2 trades
- **Hour 12:** Usually 5-10 trades
- **Hour 24:** Usually 10-20 trades
- **Hour 72:** Usually 15-30 trades total, validate strategy
